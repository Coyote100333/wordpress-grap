#WP GraphQL

### NOT PRODUCTION READY! 
This is NOT production ready yet and is currently undergoing a major refactor. Feel free to install and play with it, but things WILL break in the near future

### Installation
Install the plugin like any WP Plugin, then flush your permalinks. 

### Dev Tools
Go get the GraphiQL (ChromiQL) Chrome Extension here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromeiql/fkkiamalmpiidkljmicmjfbieiclmeij

Open the extension and set the URL to your-site.com/graphql

Check the docs in the top right to see what Queries/Mutations are available.
