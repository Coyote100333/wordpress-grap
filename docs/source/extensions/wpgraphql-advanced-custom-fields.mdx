**GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-acf](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-acf)


## Getting Started

1. Install & activate [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/).
2. Install & activate WPGraphQL.
3. Clone or download the [extension](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-acf) from GitHub & activate the **WPGraphQL Advanced Custom Fields** plugin.

## Supported Fields

WPGraphQL Advanced Custom Fields supports nearly all of the ACF (free & pro) fields. Some of the fields, such as Accordion and Tab, which are not data fields are not supported. The Clone field needs some more assessment to determine if it can properly be supported. Fields from 3rd party extensions are not supported out of the box, but we are interested in supporting the popular ones.

## ACF Options Page

Reference: [https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/add-ons/options-page/](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/add-ons/options-page/)

To add an option page and expose it to the graphql schema, simply add `'show_in_graphql' => true` when you register an option page.


#### Example Usage
```php
function register_acf_options_pages() {

    // check function exists
    if ( ! function_exists( 'acf_add_options_page' ) ) {
        return;
    }

    // register options page
    $my_options_page = acf_add_options_page(
        array(
            'page_title'      => __( 'My Options Page' ),
            'menu_title'      => __( 'My Options Page' ),
            'menu_slug'       => 'my-options-page',
            'capability'      => 'edit_posts',
            'show_in_graphql' => true,
        )
    );
}

add_action( 'acf/init', 'register_acf_options_pages' )
```

#### Example Query

```graphql
query GetMyOptionsPage {
    myOptionsPage {
        someCustomField
    }
}
```
